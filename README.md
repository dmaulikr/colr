**Even when the senses give the lead thou see'st reason hath wings too short.**

â€“ Dante in *Paradiso*


Communicating color has always placed us amidst a sea of descriptions. The language of color gives us rules, yet it seems that in the practice of *experiencing* color, rules are often incapable of doing what we want. The systematic method is insufficient for our day-to-day description. This iPhone game aims for an alternative to that fruitless approach.
