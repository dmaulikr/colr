"Even when the senses give the lead thou see'st reason hath wings too short." - Dante in *Paradiso*

Communicating a color has always placed us amidst a sea of descriptions. The language of color gives us rules, yet it seems that in the practice of *experiencing* color, the rules are often incapable of doing what we want. The systematic method with rules is insufficient to be used in the day-to-day description. This iPhone game aims to assist in that fruitless approach. 

How does the everyday mortal understand color? Seeing is not enough.
